## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A muted, calming blue (#64B5F6) to evoke a sense of reliability and clarity, aligning with the information-focused nature of weather apps.
- Background color: A light gray (#F0F4F8), subtly tinted toward the primary color to ensure content legibility.
- Accent color: A gentle yellow (#FFECB3), is used sparingly to draw attention to interactive elements like buttons or highlighted forecast days.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif for its modern and neutral look.
- Employ clear, minimalist icons to represent weather conditions; icons should be monochromatic and adaptable to both light and dark modes.
- Use a mobile-first layout strategy to ensure seamless adaptation to various screen sizes, with content structured for easy readability.
- Incorporate subtle transitions via framer-motion on data refresh or mode switch to give a fluid, modern feel.
